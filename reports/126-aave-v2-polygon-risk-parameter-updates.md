(There are some inconsistencies on the storage changes, due to inter-dependency with proposal 124, to be fixed soon)

### Technical analysis

Like on every Aave cross-chain proposal, this one follows the procedure defined on [https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-v3-crosschain-listing-template](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-v3-crosschain-listing-template). This means that after execution on Ethereum, the proposal payload will be queued on the Polygon side of the cross-chain infrastructure and, after the timelock there, will be open for execution.

From a technical perspective, we have verified that the proposal payload does the following changes on Aave v2 Polygon, by interacting with the [Aave v2 Polygon Configurator](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x26db2B833021583566323E3b8985999981b9F1F3):

- BAL
  - **Freeze** (already frozen by 124, so no extra effect)

- CRV
  - **Unfreeze**
  - **Disable borrowing**

- GHST
  - **Freeze** (already frozen by 124, so no extra effect)

- LINK
  - **Unfreeze**
  - **Disable borrowing**

- SUSHI
  - **Freeze** (already frozen by 124, so no extra effect)

- DPI (as described on the governance forum, but not as reflected in the table on the AIP)
  - **Unfreeze** (already frozen by 124, so no extra effect)
  - **Disable borrowing** (already disabled, so no extra effect)
