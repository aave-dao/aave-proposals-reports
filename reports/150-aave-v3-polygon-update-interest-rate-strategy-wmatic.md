### Technical analysis

The proposal payload properly interacts with the Aave cross-chain governance system, via the the [CrosschainForwarderPolygon](https://etherscan.io/address/0x158a6bC04F0828318821baE797f50B0A1299d45b#code), to later execute the [proposal payload on Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x7255791f9b2d44863c21ed1f484d444a74731ac6#code) doing the following:

- Call `setReserveInterestRateStrategyAddress()` on the [Aave v3 Polygon Pool Configurator contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8145eddDf43f50276641b55bd3AD95944510021E#code) to replace the interest rate strategy of wMATIC with the new proposed one.
- Call `setSupplyCap()` and `setBorrowCap()` also on the same Pool Configurator contract to set the supply cap to 47'000'000 wMATIC (from the current 32'880'000 wMATIC) and the borrow cap to 39'950'000 wMATIC (from the current 9'225'000 wMATIC).

In addition, we have verified the new rate strategy has the same parameters as those defined in the governance forum:

- Optimal point: 75%
- Base variable borrow rate: 0%
- Variable borrow slope 1: 6.1%
- Variable borrow slope 2: 100%
