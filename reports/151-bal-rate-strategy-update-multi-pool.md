### Aave Seatbelt report

**Ethereum**

[https://github.com/bgd-labs/seatbelt-for-ghosts/blob/main/reports/Aave/0xEC568fffba86c094cf06b22134B23074DFE2252c/151.md](https://github.com/bgd-labs/seatbelt-for-ghosts/blob/main/reports/Aave/0xEC568fffba86c094cf06b22134B23074DFE2252c/151.md)

**There seems to be some infrastructure problem on Tenderly, which causes the state transitions to show erroneously (`aTokenAddress` instead of the correct `interestRateStrategyAddress`). We have double checked both payload code and events emitted, and everything seems correct**


**Polygon**

### Technical analysis

This proposal has 2 target networks: Ethereum and Polygon, so we have analyzed the changes applied separately.

**Ethereum**

We have verified [the proposal payload](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3b6532efb7a60711f8f3fa77a589a726c836f4cf#code) just updates the interest rate strategy for BAL, setting a new one with the following parameters:

- Optimal point: 80%
- Base variable borrow rate: 3%
- Variable borrow slope 1: 14%
- Variable borrow slope 2: 150%

These parameters are the same as defined on the governance forum and Snapshot.

**Polygon**

The proposal payload properly interacts with the Aave cross-chain governance system, via the the [CrosschainForwarderPolygon](https://etherscan.io/address/0x158a6bC04F0828318821baE797f50B0A1299d45b#code), to later execute the [proposal payload on Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x98bc9dfa3cecb37f1bdeadc6e774d39082756b19#code) doing the following:

- Update the borrow cap of BAL from 156'530 BAL to 256'140 BAL, by calling the [Pool Configurator contract of Aave v3 Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8145eddDf43f50276641b55bd3AD95944510021E).
- Update the interest rate strategies of BAL on both Aave v2 and v3 Polygon with new ones with the following parameters:
  - Optimal point: 80%
  - Base variable borrow rate: 3%
  - Variable borrow slope 1: 14%
  - Variable borrow slope 2: 150%
