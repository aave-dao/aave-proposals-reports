**There is a infrastructural problem on Tenderly, which causes the state transitions to show erroneously. We have double checked both payload code and events emitted, and everything seems correct**

<br>

### Technical analysis

The proposal payloads do the following:
- Call the [Pool Configurator of Aave v2 Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756) to replace the current interest rate strategy of WETH with the one on deployed [HERE](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb8975328Aa52c00B9Ec1e11e518C4900f2e6C62a#code).
We verified that the only changes are on base variable borrow rate (from 0% to 1%) and variable slope 1 (from 5.75% to 3.8%).
