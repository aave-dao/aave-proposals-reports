### Proposal Types

* :wrench: :bar_chart: Configuration updates

### Context
Chaos Labs recommends adjustments to USDSâ€™s interest rate curves on the Prime and Core deployments. The frequent spikes have coincided with a decrease in borrows, as a result of large market outflows. To optimally price the asset, and to set USDS in line with other stablecoins, Chaos Labs recommend increasing the target borrow rate at UOptimal, which will also reduce the time spent above UOptimal. Specifically, Chaos Labs recommend targeting 12.5% at UOptimal and a Slope2 of 35% for both USDS markets, noting that this is aligned with the target rate for all other major stablecoin markets.
