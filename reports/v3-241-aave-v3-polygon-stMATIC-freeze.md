### Proposal Types

* :wrench: :bar_chart: Configuration updates


### Context
Given [Lidoâ€™s recent announcement to sunset stMATIC](https://blog.lido.fi/lido-on-polygon-sunset/) (their Liquid Staking Token implementation on Polygon), we propose freezing the stMATIC reserve on the Aave V3 Polygon market. This freeze would prevent users from increasing supply or creating new borrow positions, while maintaining functionality for repayments, withdrawals, and liquidations.
