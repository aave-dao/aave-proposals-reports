### Technical Analysis
We have verified the risk parameters are as specified in the ipfs. We have verified the price feed has the correct capo and chainlink price feed source.

Moreover, for each underlying and aToken of the newly listed asset, the proposal sets the ACI multisig as the emission manager.

The proposal is consistent with the description on both Snapshot and the governance forum.
